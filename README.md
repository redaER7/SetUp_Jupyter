Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. Uses include data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.

Although Julia, Python, and R were the first languages that Jupyter notebook was built to support (and named after), new versions offer support for multiple programming languages.
